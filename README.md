This project details the process of training a bipedal walker using reinforcement learning techniques. The chosen reinforcement learning method will be a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. TD3 is a model-free and off-policy reinforcement learning method and it will be
used for training in the Open AI gym BipedalWalker-v3 environment and the BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3 environment.
